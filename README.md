### About me

**BLA BLA!**

The most daunting challenges, that's the kind of projects I like to join and work for. Thereby I really enjoy participating in hackathons with friends, thinking or developing new projects and learning new technologies. This days I'm learning React, as I already have a strong knowledge in **Backend** (at least for the project requirements I needed) I wanted to give a try to this known way of developing the **Frontend**. I have started to use **Docker** on my last projects, alongside a Ci/Cd environment with **CircleCI**, which brings you a great adaptability to this always-changing and fast-paced developing society. This is more **DevOps** related, but to be a great Fullstack you should know a bunch of things 🤘🏽 .

I love board sports (surf/kite/snow), football and bouldering. If you want to get my 100% attention, just explain something unknown for me 🤯 &nbsp; or make me laugh 😁  &nbsp;. I don't drink **coffee** btw.
